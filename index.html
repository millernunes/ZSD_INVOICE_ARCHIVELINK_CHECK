<p>With the advent of Electronic Invoices the government's started to request that the company's store the Print Invoice Documents for a determined period of time. So, some companies begun to use SAP <a href="https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw70/helpdata/en/5e/566039b85f9443e10000000a114084/frameset.htm">ArchiveLink</a> Standard solution in order to store the invoices. </p>

<p>But, with the passing of years, some companies realize that some documents were archived more than once or, even worse, they weren't archived at all. This situation occurs because the companies didn't create mechanisms that allows them archive all Invoice documents and that avoid those documents are archived more than once. </p>

<p>The Idea of this project is create a new tool that enables the companies identify which documents are archived, and how many times they are stored. </p>

<p>Below you can see the screenshots of the program:</p>
