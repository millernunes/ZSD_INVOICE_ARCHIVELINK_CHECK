{"name":"SAP SD Invoice ArchiveLink Check","tagline":"SAP ArchiveLink Invoices check for SD","body":"### Welcome SAP SD Invoice ArchiveLink Check Project\r\n\r\nWith the advent of Electronic Invoices the government's started to request that the company's store the Print Invoice Documents for a determined period of time. So, some companies begun to use SAP [ArchiveLink](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw70/helpdata/en/5e/566039b85f9443e10000000a114084/frameset.htm) Standard solution in order to store the invoices. \r\n\r\nBut, with the passing of years, some companies realize that some documents were archived more than once or, even worse, they weren't archived at all. This situation occurs because the companies didn't create mechanisms that allows them archive all Invoice documents and that avoid those documents are archived more than once. \r\n\r\nThe Idea of this project is create a new tool that enables the companies identify which documents are archived, and how many times they are stored. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
