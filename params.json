{"name":"SAP SD Invoice ArchiveLink Check","tagline":"SAP ArchiveLink Invoices check for SD","body":"### Welcome SAP SD Invoice ArchiveLink Check Project\r\n\r\nWith the advent of Electronic Invoices the government's started to request that the company's store the Print Invoice Documents for a determined period of time. So, some companies begun to use SAP [ArchiveLink](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw70/helpdata/en/5e/566039b85f9443e10000000a114084/frameset.htm) Standard solution in order to store the invoices. \r\n\r\nBut, with the passing of years, some companies realize that some documents were archived more than once or, even worse, they weren't archived at all. This situation occurs because the companies didn't create mechanisms that allows them archive all Invoice documents and that avoid those documents are archived more than once. \r\n\r\nThe Idea of this project is create a new tool that enables the companies identify which documents are archived, and how many times they are stored. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
