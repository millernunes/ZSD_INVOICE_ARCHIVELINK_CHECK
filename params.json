So, some companies begun to use SAP [ArchiveLink](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw70/helpdata/en/5e/566039b85f9443e10000000a114084/frameset.htm) Standard solution in order to store the invoices. \r\n\r\nBut, with the passing of years, some companies realize that some documents were archived more than once or, even worse, they weren't archived at all. This situation occurs because the companies didn't create mechanisms that allows them archive all Invoice documents and that avoid those documents are archived more than once. \r\n\r\nThe Idea of this project is create a new tool that enables the companies identify which documents are archived, and how many times they are stored. \r\n\r\nBelow you can see the screenshots of the program:\r\n\r\n![Selection Screen](https://github.com/millernunes/ZSD_INVOICE_ARCHIVELINK_CHECK/blob/gh-pages/images/IMAGE_01.jpg)\r\n![Main Screen](https://github.com/millernunes/ZSD_INVOICE_ARCHIVELINK_CHECK/blob/gh-pages/images/IMAGE_02.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is covered by MIT License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 MILLER NUNES\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
